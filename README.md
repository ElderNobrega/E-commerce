# e-commerce clothing project

## This is a React project design for e-commerce website. 

## Bellow I will be detailing all the technologies I have been using

### SASS:
Node-SASS is a library that allows provides biding for node.js to libSass. 
It allows us to compile scss to css. It has a lot of qualities and life improvements 

### Firebase:
Using firebase cloud firestore as a database for the project. 

### Redux: 
As the app is growing I find that redux will help me to have more control of the states that I will be needing.
Also, it will increase my knowledge with Redux

### Reselect: 
As we have a state being rerendered in every state updates, even though it is the same state, this is not what we want. This is where reselect comes in. 

### Redux Persist: 
Installed Redux persist to keep state saved when refresh the page!!

### Styles Components:
Create a new branch to test style components. It is a feature to have a css in JS as a component. It`s nice to have more css control in each component instead of in the entire app. It is a very nice scalability, whoever it comes with a tradeoff of learning another technology.
